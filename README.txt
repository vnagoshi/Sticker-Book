Sticker-Book

Sticker Book is a Java application where you can place stickers on a page, save
  your designs, and interact with your stickers.

User Guide:
  Placing a Sticker:
    To place a sticker, open the sticker palate (top leftmost button) then select 
    from the drop down menu which sticker you would like to place on the page.
    Click anywhere on the page to place the sticker.
    
    By default when you place a sticker, you will not be able to place another
    sticker without reselecting a sticker from the sticker palate. If you would
    like to place multiple of the same sticker without reselcting it, turn on
    "place multiple" (second button from the left).
    
  Moving a Sticker:
    To move a sticker turn "move" on (third button from the left). Click on the sticker
    you would like to move then click where you want to move it on the page.
    
    When move is not on, clicking on a sticker will play its default sound.
    
  Erasing a Sticker:
    To erase a sticker, turn erase mode on (third button from the right). Then click
    on the sticker on the page to erase it. To erase all stickers on the page, click
    the clear all button (second button from the right).
    
    You can also right click on a sticker to erase it.
    
  Saving and Loading your Page
    To save your page, click on the save button (fifth button from the left). This
    will save all stickers on the page and the current theme. To load a save, click
    on the load button (right of the save button). Only one save file is currently
    supported. Note, loading a save will overwrite all stickers currently on the page.
    
  Changing the Page Theme
    To change the page theme, hit the theme button (rightmost button). There are
    currently two supported themes.
    
  Cursor Mode:
    Turning cursor mode on (fourth button from the left) shows you a preview of the
    sticker you are placing/moving.
